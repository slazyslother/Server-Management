# Server Management

This project involves setting up a web server using Nginx or Apache. The server will be configured to serve different types of applications, including static sites and reverse proxies for APIs. Additionally, the project includes implementing security measures such as SSL/TLS encryption and firewalls to ensure the server's security.

<br/>

## Features

- __Web Server Setup__: Configure Nginx or Apache as the web server.
- __Application Hosting__: Host various types of applications, including static sites and APIs.
- __Reverse Proxy Configuration__: Set up reverse proxy configurations to route requests to backend services.
- __SSL/TLS Encryption__: Implement SSL/TLS encryption to secure communication between clients and the server.
- __Firewall Configuration__: Configure firewall rules to control incoming and outgoing traffic and enhance server security.

<br/>

## Utility Functions

- __Server Configuration Scripts__: Scripts for setting up and configuring the web server.
- __SSL Certificate Management__: Scripts or tools for managing SSL/TLS certificates.
- __Firewall Configuration__: Scripts or tools for configuring firewall rules.

<br/>

## Implementation

- __Web Server Installation__: Install and configure Nginx or Apache as the web server.
- __Application Configuration__: Configure virtual hosts or server blocks to host different types of applications.
- __Reverse Proxy Setup__: Configure reverse proxy rules to forward requests to backend services.
- __SSL/TLS Certificate Installation__: Obtain and install SSL/TLS certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
- __Firewall Configuration__: Set up firewall rules using tools like iptables or firewalld to control traffic flow.

<br/>

## Testing

- __Security Testing__: Perform security testing to identify vulnerabilities in the server configuration.
- __Load Testing__: Test the server's performance under heavy load to ensure scalability and reliability.
- __SSL/TLS Certificate Testing__: Verify SSL/TLS certificate configuration to ensure proper encryption.

<br/>

## Example Scenarios

- __Static Site Hosting__: Configure the web server to serve a static website and verify that it is accessible from the internet.
- __API Reverse Proxy__: Set up a reverse proxy configuration to forward requests to an API backend and test API functionality.
- __SSL/TLS Encryption__: Enable SSL/TLS encryption for the server and verify secure communication.
- __Firewall Configuration__: Configure firewall rules to allow/deny specific types of traffic and test firewall functionality.
